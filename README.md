# VR Sword Fighting Game

This game made in Unity you're a human-like Android on a quest through a procedurally generated Apocalyptic City fighting enemies with a sword that looks very similar to a lightsaber. This game runs on the Samsung GearVR and Perception's Neuron Axis Motion Capture suit. This project was a group made by 22 computer science students at the California State University, Monterey Bay. 

An important of this project was the integration of Perceptions Neuron Axis suit. We got in the January 2016 when the suit still in the Beta development phase. With the PERCEPTION NEURON could be used for different applications in the fields of VFX, game interaction, virtual reality, sport analysis, medical analysis, real-time stage performance and etc.
