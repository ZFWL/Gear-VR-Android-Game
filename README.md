# VR Sword Fighting Game

This game(made in Unity) you're a human-like Android on a quest through a procedurally generated Apocalyptic City fighting enemies with a sword that looks very similar to a lightsaber. This game runs on the Samsung Gear VR headset and Perception Neuron Motion Capture Suit. This project was a group effort made by 22 computer science students along with 4 game design students at the California State University, Monterey Bay in the CST 495 Special Topics class.

# Upcoming Level Design
A new level is coming(Late 2017/Early 2018). It will take out of the City and onto an abandoned Farm where you will have face new enemies and obstacles to continue your quest.

# Neuron Motion Capture Suit
An important part of this project was the integration of the Perception Neuron Motion Capture suit. It was received in January 2016 when the suit was still in the Beta development phase.

# Vulkan Support 
Vulkan is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs in both PCs and on mobile platforms. The Android Nougat version 7.0 from Google brings official support for the Vulkan API.The main benefit of Vulkan over older mobile rendering APIs such as OpenGL ES 3.x is speed. Vulkan is designed to take advantage of multiple CPU cores by allowing the application to build command lists in multiple threads in parallel. This allows the application to take advantage of all of the CPU cores on the device, improving performance.

To enable Vulkan support, open “Player Settings”, go to the “Other Settings” pane and clear the “Auto Graphics API” checkbox. You are presented with an ordered list of graphics APIs to choose from. If Vulkan is not on that list, click the ‘+’ sign at the bottom of the list to add it. Then drag Vulkan to be the first item on the list so that it’ll be used whenever supported, and you’re done! All your existing shaders will get translated to Vulkan SPIR-V.
